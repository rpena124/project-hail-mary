Proejct Title: Project Hail Mary

Motivation: 
I chose to try and recreate Streets of Rage because, like many games and the Science Fiction genre, it's a commentary on the environment that we are presently living in. I wanted to pull more inspiration from books like "The Memory Police" by Yoko Ogawa, "The Handmaid's Tale" by Margaret Atwood. All of these deal with governments taking the rights of their people or sub-group of individuals. 

These themes are pertinent with the US Supreme Court overturning Roe v. Wade, taking away women's right to choose and taking away women's agency over their one bodies and reproductive health.
